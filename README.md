# Myorcadial-Infraction-Prediction

## Project Aim
The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of myocardial infarction (heart attack) in individuals based on various behavioral and health-related factors. By leveraging advanced data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, this project seeks to contribute significantly to the early identification of high-risk individuals, enabling timely intervention and reducing the occurrence of heart attacks.

## Importance
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with myocardial infarction being a major contributor. Early detection and prevention of heart attacks are crucial in reducing mortality rates and improving overall public health. By accurately predicting the risk of myocardial infarction, healthcare professionals can provide targeted interventions, promote lifestyle changes, and prescribe appropriate medications to those at high risk, ultimately saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS collects data from participants across the United States, providing valuable insights into various aspects of public health, including behavioral risk factors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive services. This comprehensive and reliable dataset is the foundation of our myocardial infarction prediction model, allowing for robust and accurate analysis.
